---

## Between Quests

### Automatic Restoration

---

## Death & Recovery

### Dead Heroes
A hero dies when:
- Body Points are reduced to **0**
- AND they do not have a healing potion or spell available

### What Happens to a Dead Hero?
- Hero is out of the game for **rest of that quest**
- Player may rename hero and play as new character in **next quest**
- Armor, weapons, and treasures can be picked up by other heroes in the room
- **Warning:** If no other heroes in room/corridor, monsters claim all possessions

### How a Hero Escapes Death
If Body Points reach 0, there are two ways to survive:

1. **Healing Potion:** If you have a potion that restores life, drink it immediately. Your Body Points are raised above 0, restoring you to life.

2. **Healing Spell:** If you are a spellcaster with an unused healing spell AND have not already performed an action this turn, cast the spell on yourself.

### Important Timing
- Once Body Points reach 0, you cannot be saved by a **fellow hero's** spell or potion
- It is too late—you die by the time it is your fellow hero's turn
- The only time a fellow hero can save you is on **their turn** (before you reach 0)

### After Death
- If hero dies during quest, they cannot participate further
- Other heroes may continue the quest
- Dead hero's player may observe but not advise
